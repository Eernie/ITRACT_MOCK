Data format standard: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#The_application.2Fx-www-form-urlencoded_type

For the http put body (without newlines) (needs to be URLEncoded before sending & URLDecoded after receiving) the possible parameters are:

- confirm=<true/false>
- rating=<int>

Example:

1) To confirm match 1, a put request to https://<server>/match/1 is sent with the body
confirm=true
Which needs to be URLEncoded to: 
confirm%3Dtrue

-----------------------------------

2) To rate match 1, a put request to https://<server>/match/1 is sent with the body
rating=8
Which needs to be URLEncoded to: 
rating%3D8
